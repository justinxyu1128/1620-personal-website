    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <p>My name is Justin Yu, I'm from Canada. Despite being Taiwanese, I prefer western food. 
        I am picky, and prefer simpler foods over exotic ones. Two of the big deciding factors 
        in my enjoyment of food are <strong>texture</strong>, and <strong>taste</strong>. I can tell
        if I will like a food by smell and sight alone. This technique almost <em>never</em> fails.
